# opsdashboard-extensions-playground
This is a place with extensions built for Operations Dashboard for ArcGIS. An extension is a web application plugged-in to the Operations Dashboard application which runs on both Windows and browser platforms. Extension can interact with Dashboard through data manipulation, map interaction, or through other business-focused functionality. 

Extensions in this repository are either experimental, under still construction, or both. This repository has no association with the Operations Dashboard samples repository under https://github.com/Esri.
